**Question 1. What is the OOps and there conecpts?.
**Answer 1. OOps is (object oriented programing concept) a methodology or a technique of that 
we design program or software using the classes and objects.

There conectps are : -
1. Class
2. Object 
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism
5. Encapsulation
6. Abstraction

Class :---- Class is a blue print of the object. and its doesn't have any space and it is a logical entity. 
Object : --- It is a instance of the class and it have state and behavior.
Inheritance : -- When a class is extend into the another class that's called the inheritance.
Polymorphism : --- When a task is done into different ways is called polymorphism. It's have method overloading and method overriding 
we call method overloading as a compile time polymorphism and method overrriding is called run time polymorphism.
Encapsulation : --- When bind the data and methods into a signle unit its called encapsulation.
Abstraction : --- When hidding the internal detail and showing only the required functionality called absraction.
Also we called data hidding.



**Question 2. What is the heap memory and stack memory?.
**Answer 2. 
Heap memory is a area in the memory and it is allocted at the runtime for to store the value of objects, arrays, or strings etc. 
It store the value of the reference variables.

Stack memory where the all veriables and methods are stored.

Example :
A a = new A();
B b = new B();

a.name = "Dev"
b.name = "Pandey"

[a,b] =============[(a.name="Dev"),(b.name="Pandey)]
Stack Memeroy       Heap Memory
