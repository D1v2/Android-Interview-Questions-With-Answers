**Question 1. What is the OOps and there conecpts?.
**Answer 1. OOps is (object oriented programing concept) a methodology or a technique of that 
we design program or software using the classes and objects.

There conectps are : -
1. Class
2. Object 
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism
5. Encapsulation
6. Abstraction

Class :---- Class is a blue print of the object. and its doesn't have any space and it is a logical entity. 
Object : --- It is a instance of the class and it have state and behavior.
Inheritance : -- When a class is extend into the another class that's called the inheritance.
Polymorphism : --- When a task is done into different ways is called polymorphism. It's have method overloading and method overriding 
we call method overloading as a compile time polymorphism and method overrriding is called run time polymorphism.
Encapsulation : --- When bind the data and methods into a signle unit its called encapsulation.
Abstraction : --- When hidding the internal detail and showing only the required functionality called absraction.
Also we called data hidding.



**Question 2. What is the heap memory and stack memory?.
**Answer 2. 
Heap memory is a area in the memory and it is allocted at the runtime for to store the value of objects, arrays, or strings etc. 
It store the value of the reference variables.

Stack memory where the all veriables and methods are stored.

Example :
A a = new A();
B b = new B();

a.name = "Dev"
b.name = "Pandey"

[a,b] =============[(a.name="Dev"),(b.name="Pandey)]
Stack Memeroy       Heap Memory

**Question 3. What is the abstraction?.
**Answer 3. 
Abstraction is that hidding the implementation details from the user and show only functionality.
We can achieve this using abstract class or interface.

Abstract Class - Abstract keyword is used before the class and one or more method can be abstract function 
and abstract function doesn't have any body. We can create the instance of the abstract classes.

Interface - Interface is a collections of the abstract methods and methods doesn't have any body and 
they only define implementation are not present.


**Question 4. What is the encapsulation ?.
**Answer 4. Encapsulation is a machanism where variables and methods are binded into single unit and we also know as data hiding.
In this all varibles are private or hidden for the other classes and they are accessable by the methods.

**Question 5. What is the singleton and what is the singleton class ?.
**Answer 5 . Singleton pattern is a design pattern and this type of pattern came under the creation pattern as this pattern provide the 
best way to create the objects.

Singleton Class : That class only one object will produce thats class called the signleton class.


**Question 6. What is wrapper class and what is the int and Integer how int is different from the Integer ?.
**Answer 6. We are working with the primitives data types some time we need to use the object of the primitives data type then use 
the wrapper classes. Wrapper classes are Integer,Byte etc.

When converting int value to integer its called boxing its done by the compiler and when convert Integer to int its called the 
unboxing.

** int is a primitive data type and Integer is a wrapper class when creating variable with the wrapper class that's called a object.

**Question 7. What is enum class and can we use the constructor of this class ?.
**Anser 7. Enum class is special kind of class that have a group of predefine values.
We can create a constructor of enum class for set the defualt value, and its a private if we change to the public it
give the compile time error.


**Question 8. What is the Serialization ?.
**Answer 8. Serialization is mechanism where objects can be represented as a sequence of the bytes that include's object's 
data as well as the information of the objects type and that types data store into the object.

After the serializtion object bytes are store into a file from that file deserilaztion be done. from the bytes and type object used to 
recreate object into the memory.
